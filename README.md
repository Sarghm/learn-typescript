### Why TypeScript?

- Safer, cleaner, easier to read
TypeScript catches common JavaScript errors whilst you write, rather than after you've shipped - allowing you to confidently ship more reliable, bug-free code.

- Use the latest and greatest features of JavaScript
The TypeScript team include newer features of JavaScript before they hit the mainstream, allowing you to get ahead of the curve whilst still writing code that's deliverable everywhere.

- Be ready for your next job role
With companies like Google, Airbnb and Slack adopting TypeScript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/), there's no better time to skill up and prepare for your next job interview.

- Deploy TypeScript everywhere you can deploy JavaScript
TypeScript files are compiled down to JavaScript files after being checked for errors, which means you can write TypeScript and deploy it anywhere you would deploy JavaScript.

- You probably won't go back to JavaScript
According to insights measured by Stack Overflow (https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved), TypeScript was 2020's second most loved language among developers.

### Bio

My name's Sam, and I'll be your guide through your TypeScript journey! I'm an award-winning software engineeer with almost a decade's worth of experience in the field, and over a half a million App Store app downloads to my name.

It's safe to say I've tried my hand at plenty of different programming languages along the way. Out of all of them, TypeScript has been the one that's excited me more than any other - and that's the reason I wrote this course.
